      <description>aka - Chocolate chip Pecan Oat Bran Banana Bread I workout a lot but I also have a sweet tooth. This is recipe I came up with as a way to have a healthier alternative to a more traditional banana bread. I am still tweaking this so it may change but I think it is rady to share.
Growing up and far into my adult life my mom has made banana bread for my family and we usually finish it before it cools.</description>
