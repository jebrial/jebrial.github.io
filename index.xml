      <description>What we put in our bodies matters more than anything. The main drive of posts like this are to inspire healthy eating alternatives to those frequent cravings(if you are like me). I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call this a low calorie recipe but it is nutritious. Complex carbs, high fiber, healthy monounsaturated fat, low sugar and low saturated fat. It is still a lot of calories but great a substitute for a chocolate chip cookie craving.</description>
