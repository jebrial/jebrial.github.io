### aka - Chocolate Chip Pecan Oat Bran Banana Bread

What we put in our bodies matters more than anything. I work out a lot but I also have a sweet tooth. The main drive of posts like this are to inspire healthy eating alternatives to those frequent cravings(if you are like me). I wouldn't call this a low calorie recipe but it is nutritious. Complex carbs, high fiber, healthy monounsaturated fat, low sugar and low saturated fat. It is still a lot of calories but great a substitute for a chocolate chip cookie craving. A piece of this is even good before a run!

Growing up and far into my adult life, my mom routinely made banana bread for our family. Typically, we finish the whole loaf before it cools. She did a few things to make it healthier: she used half whole wheat flour instead of all white flour, she substituted vegetable oil for butter, and she even cut the sugar down by half.

This is a recipe I came up with as a way to have a healthier alternative to the traditional banana bread. I have been trying to take this to the next level without sacrificing delicious flavor and I am pretty close. I'm still tweaking some aspects of the recipe so it may change, but I'm ready to share!

## Ingredients

### Wet Mixture
* 1/3 cup egg whites
* 1 cup oat milk (or milk type of your choice)
* 2-3 ripe bananas (mashed)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 3/4 teaspoon stevia sweater (I used a brand called Wholesome)
* 1/4 cup olive oil

### Dry Mixture
* 1/3 cup flax meal
* 1/4 cup chia seeds
* 1/3 cup whey protein (unflavored)
* 1/3 cup oat bran
* 1/3 cup rolled oats
* 2/3 cup whole wheat flour (I use Bob's Red Mill 100% stone ground)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 cup chocolate chips ( I use lily's stevia sweetened dark chocolate chips)
* 1 cup pecan halves (crushed)
* some pecans to top the loaf after you pour it in the pan

## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
2. Mix each group of ingredients separately. Then combine the two and you should end up with a very goopy (almost soupy) batter.
3. Oil (or butter) a 6 x 9 casserole dish or similar size quick bread pan. I actually recommend still using butter to grease the pan. It is a small amount and works better to brown the edges. Optional: Sprinkle a small amount of pecans to decorate the top. ðŸŒš
4. Bake at 375 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. Take out and let cool. Enjoy.
