# aka - Chocolate Chip Pecan Oat Bran Banana Bread

I workout a lot but I also have a sweet tooth. This is a recipe I came up with as a way to have a healthier alternative to a more traditional banana bread. I am still tweaking this so it may change but I think it is ready to share.

Growing up and far into my adult life my mom has made banana bread for my family and we usually finish it before it cools. She did a few things to make it healthier. She used half whole wheat flour instead of all white flour. She cut the butter in half and replaced it with vegetable oil. She even cut the sugar a bit.

I have been trying to take this recipe to the next level but maintain a delicious flavor. I think I am close. The ingredients are listed below. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. The first group of ingredients is the wet mix and the second is the dry mix. Mix each group separately then combine the two and you should end up with a very goopy(almost soupy) batter. Oil or butter a 6 x 9 casserole dish or similar size quick bread pan. I actually recommend still using butter to grease the pan. It is a small amount and works better to brown the edges. Use a small amount of pecans to decorate the top. Bake at 375 degrees for 30 to 35 minutes. Take out and let cool. Enjoy.


## Ingredients:

### wet mix in a large bowl:
* 1/3 cup egg whites
* 1 cup oat milk (or milk type of your choice)
* 2-3 ripe bananas (mashed)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 3/4 teaspoon stevia sweater (I used a brand called Wholesome)
* 1/4 cup olive oil

### dry mix in a medium bowl:
* 1/3 cup flax meal
* 1/4 cup chia seeds
* 1/3 cup whey protein (unflavored)
* 1/3 cup oat bran
* 1/3 cup rolled oats
* 2/3 cup whole wheat flour (I use Bob's Red Mill 100% stone ground)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 cup chocolate chips ( I use lily's stevia sweetened dark chocolate chips)
* 1 cup pecan halves (crushed)
* some pecans to top the loaf after you pour it in the pan


 What we put in our bodies matters more than anything. The main drive of posts like this are to inspire healthy eating alternatives to those frequent cravings(if you are like me). I wouldn't call this a low calorie recipe but I do think it is nutritious. Complex carbs, high fiber, healthy monounsaturated fat, low sugar and low saturated fat. It is still a lot of calories but great a substitute for a chocolate chip cookie craving. I think a piece of this is even good before a run!
